# *CoFFee*

Matlab toolbox for multibeam sonar data processing.

### Description

*CoFFee* is a free and open-source MATLAB toolbox (i.e., a libary of functions) for reading multibeam sonar raw data files, visualizing their contents, and applying various processsing algorithms. It serves as the engine for several apps/GUIs designed for specific applications.

### Disclaimer

*CoFFee* is the (messy) repository of functions written and edited over the authors' career, which started before they used git. As a result, many functions are obsolete, or don't work with newer functions, or even work at all. This is why this toolbox is noted as in pre-release and will remain so until the authors can clean it all up. Expect headaches if you try to use the less commonly-used functions!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* [MATLAB](https://au.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html). We are currently using R2020b, but it may work on other versions.
* Some MATLAB toolboxes (not all functions require them):
  * Mapping Toolbox
  * Parallel Computing Toolbox
  * Signal Processing Toolbox
  * Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
  
### Installing and using

* Clone or download the repository.
* Add the toolbox's folder and subfolders to the Matlab's path by adding the following lines at the top of your scripts:

```
coffeeFolder = 'C:\my\path\to\CoFFee';
addpath(genpath(coffeeFolder));
```

## For developers

Please maintain the *CoFFee* coding philosophy, which is that any core functionality (raw file reading, conversion, data processing, etc.) is coded as *CoFFee* functions, so that only user-interaction functionalities (display, user interface, callbacks, etc.) are coded in apps. This allows reusing core functionalities across apps. Therefore, the development of an app requires the joint development of *CoFFee*, and since there are multiple apps built on *CoFFee*, careful version-controlling and dependency-management is necessary to avoid breaking compatibility.

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to attribute version numbers:
* The version of *CoFFee* is hard-coded in function `CFF_coffee_version.m`.
* The version of an app is (usually) a static property of the app (`Version`), alongside the *CoFFee* version it was built on (`CoffeeVersion`).

A careful sequence to develop an app is the following:

1. Checkout the latest commits on the main branches of both *CoFFee* and the app you wish to develop.
2. Check if that latest version of the app uses the latest version of *CoFFee* (in the code, or warning at start-up). 
3. If the app is running on an older version of *CoFFee*, fix that first:
    * Start with updating the app to use that latest version of *CoFFee*.
    * Before committing those changes, increase the app's version number and update which *CoFFee* version it runs on. 
    * After committing, remember to add the new tag on git.
4. Develop the app as you wish. Remember that all processing goes ideally in *CoFFee* and all display and user interface on the app.
5. When done, increase the app's version number (app property `Version`)
6. If *CoFFee* was modified, increase *CoFFee*'s version number (`CFF_coffee_version.m`), and update in the app which *CoFFee* version it was built on (app property `CoffeeVersion`).
7. Verify that everything works:
    * In MATLAB, run `restoredefaultpath` to ensure you get a clean path.
    * Delete the user folder to start from a clean slate.
    * Start the app, check on the start messages that all versions are correct
    * Test all features of the app.
8. Push the app up on git. Add a version tag.
9. If *CoFFee* was modified, push it up on git. Add a version tag.
10. If you wish to compile/release this new version of the app:
    * Compile:
      * Double-click on the app's `*.prj` file to start the Application Compiler with existing settings.
      * Reset dependencies:
        * Remove the app's "main file" (the `*.mlapp` file if using the app designer) to remove all the files required. This might take a few seconds.
        * Remove any remaining files and folders in the list of files required.
        * Add the "main file" again and wait for the application compiler to find all required files. This might take a few seconds.
        * Add any other files and folders in the list of files required.
      * Update the version number:
        * In the setup file name ("Packaging Options" panel, "Runtime downloaded from web" field)
        * In the "application information" panel
        * In the "Default installation folder" field.
      * Details:
        * All paths in "Settings" should be in the "Espresso\bin" folder.
      * Click on "Save".
      * Click on "Package".
    * Test that the compiled version works correctly.
      * Uninstall any previous version of the app, and delete the user folder.
      * Install the new executable with the setup file.
      * Test that the installed software runs correctly.
    * Create a new release on github
      * Go to the new tag and create a new release
      * Add binaries to the new release:
        * The binary setup (iskaffe_v***_setup.exe)
        * A zipped file of the "for_redistribution_files_only" folder
      * Fill in the release notes by copy-pasting the release notes of the previous release (Sections Download, New features, Bug fixes) and edit them
      * In the Download section, make sure to edit the links to the new release's binaries
      * Publish the new release
      * Test that the download links are correct
    * Update the link of the "Download Latest release installer" button on the app's README.md
      * Tese that the new download link works
