%CFF_FUNCTION_NAME  One-line description of what the function performs
%
%   Optional multiple lines of information giving more details about the
%   function. The first line above (so-called H1 line) has no space before
%   the function name and two spaces after. CFF_FUNCTION_NAME and other
%   functions are written in upper-case throughout this docstring. One or
%   multiple examples syntaxes follow. The docstring is completed by a "See
%   also" section that allows help functions such as "help" or "doc" to
%   automatically create hyperlinks. Separated from the docstring by a
%   single empty line are the copyright and license information.
%
%   [X,Y] = CFF_FUNCTION_NAME(A,B,C) returns the sum of A+B as X, and C as
%   Y. The first sentence was a short description of what the command does,
%   and can be followed by additional information. This first syntax shows
%   the basic and default use. Note the input and output variables are also
%   written in upper case.
%
%   X = CFF_FUNCTION_NAME(A,B) returns the sum of A+B as X. This is an
%   example of alternative syntax, showing non-default use. 
%
%   CFF_FUNCTION_NAME(...,'alsoAdd',D) returns the sum of A+B+D. This is
%   another syntax to introduce optional or parameter inputs. Since the
%   basic inputs and outputs have already been discussed, they can be
%   ommitted, so the text focuses exclusively on what the option does
%   compared to the basic syntax.
