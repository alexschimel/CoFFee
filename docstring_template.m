%CFF_FUNCTION_NAME  One-line description of what the function performs
%
%   Optional multiple lines of information giving more details about the
%   function. The first line above (so-called H1 line) has no space before
%   the function name and two spaces after. CFF_FUNCTION_NAME is written in
%   upper-case throughout this docstring. One or multiple examples syntaxes
%   follow. The docstring is completed by a "See also" section that allows
%   help functions such as "help" or "doc" to automatically create
%   hyperlinks. Separated from the docstring by a single empty line are the
%   author(s) and information on last versions.
%
%   [X,Y] = CFF_FUNCTION_NAME(A,B,C) returns the sum of A+B as X, and C as
%   Y. Note the input and output variables are also written in upper case.
%   This first syntax should show the basic use
%
%   X = CFF_FUNCTION_NAME(A,B) returns the sum of A+B as X, since the
%   additional input and outputs in this example are unecessary. This other
%   syntax shows alterative functioning.
%
%   CFF_FUNCTION_NAME(...,'parameter',VAL) is another syntax to introduce
%   optional or paramter inputs. Since the basic inputs and outputs have
%   already been discussed, they can be ommitted, so the text focuses
%   exclusively on what the option does compared to the basic syntax.
