'obsolete' is for obsolete functions, which have been replaced by newer ones. Keeping them here for backward compatibility. 
For dev: add a note in their docstring (or better a disp) to indicate they are obsolete and indicate the recplacement function.

'to_sort' are old CoFFee v1 functions, which I still need to go through to see if they are compatible with CoFFee v2.

Keep the name zzz_old to ensure those functions are found LOWER in the path, compared to newer functions with the same name.
