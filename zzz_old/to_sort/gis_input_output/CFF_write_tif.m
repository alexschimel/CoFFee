%% write tfw

A = X(1,2)-X(1,1); %Line 1: x-scale. This is the horizontal distance in meters represented by each pixel. So in the above example each pixel is .6 meters wide. 
D = 0;             %Line 2: Rotation about y axis. 
B = 0;             %Line 3: Rotation about x axis. 
E = Y(2,1)-Y(1,1); %Line 4: y-scale This is the vertical distance in meters represented by each pixel. So in the above example each pixel is .6 meters tall. Normally negative, because whilst an image has its origin in the top left corner, for Northings and Eastings the origin is normally considered to be the bottom left corner - hence why the scale is normally negative. 
C = X(1,1);        %Line 5: x-reference point. This is the horizontal coordinate (or Easting) of the center of the top left pixel. 
F = Y(1,1);        %Line 6: y-reference point. This is the vertical coordinate (or Northing) of the center of the top left pixel. 

fid = fopen([filename '.tfw'], 'wt');
